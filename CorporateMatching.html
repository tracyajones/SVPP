</h3>

<p>
    Many companies offer matching gift benefits to their employees, doubling the value of their charitable
    contributions. These donations make a critical difference for SVPP to carry out our mission.
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    Before you make your gift to SVPP, please check in the matching gift company search box below—or with your company's
    human resources or benefits office—to see if your employer has a corporate matching gift program that will make your
    support go twice as far.

    The matching gift process differs from company to company. Some require a completed paper acknowledgment form, while
    others have an online system. Others still request that claims be filed by telephone. In any case, if your company
    does provide a matching gift claim form, please complete it and send it to:
</p>
<p>
    Silicon Valley Pet Project<br>
    P.O. Box 6145<br>
    San Jose, CA 95150<br>
</p>
<p>
    Some companies require signed originals, but others may accept faxed forms. Please check with your employer to be
    sure before you fax your claim form to SVPP at 408.610.4020.
