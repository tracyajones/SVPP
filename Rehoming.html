<h1 style="border: 1px solid #cccccc; padding: 5px 10px; background: #eeeeee;">Rehoming</h1>

<p>We receive many emails and phone calls from worried owners who need to re-home their beloved pet. As a foster-based
    non-profit animal welfare organization, we spend our limited resources on saving cats and dogs from our local animal
    shelter. These pets are injured, sick, scared with no families to advocate for them, and they are often at risk of
    euthanasia at the shelter.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    We hope that you will review these resources and seek assistance from family and friends to help rehome your pet -
    you know them better than anyone, and they are counting on you!<br>
